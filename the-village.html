        <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="2" data-nb-words="800" data-nb-chars="4395"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="2" id="idea2" data-nb-words="52" data-nb-chars="287">After hoeing, or&nbsp;perhaps reading and writing, in&nbsp;the forenoon, I&nbsp;usually bathed again in&nbsp;the pond, swimming across one of&nbsp;its coves for a&nbsp;stint, and washed the dust of&nbsp;labor from my&nbsp;person, or&nbsp;smoothed out the last wrinkle which study had made, and for the afternoon was absolutely free.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" id="idea3" data-nb-words="55" data-nb-chars="304">Every day or&nbsp;two I&nbsp;strolled to&nbsp;the village to&nbsp;hear some of&nbsp;the gossip which is&nbsp;incessantly going on&nbsp;there, circulating either from mouth to&nbsp;mouth, or&nbsp;from newspaper to&nbsp;newspaper, and which, taken in&nbsp;homoeopathic doses, was really as&nbsp;refreshing in&nbsp;its way as&nbsp;the rustle of&nbsp;leaves and the peeping of&nbsp;frogs.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="4" id="idea4" data-nb-words="36" data-nb-chars="170">As&nbsp;I&nbsp;walked in&nbsp;the woods to&nbsp;see the birds and squirrels, so&nbsp;I&nbsp;walked in&nbsp;the village to&nbsp;see the men and boys; instead of&nbsp;the wind among the pines I&nbsp;heard the carts rattle.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="5" id="idea5" data-nb-words="59" data-nb-chars="306">In&nbsp;one direction from my&nbsp;house there was a&nbsp;colony of&nbsp;muskrats in&nbsp;the river meadows; under the grove of&nbsp;elms and buttonwoods in&nbsp;the other horizon was a&nbsp;village of&nbsp;busy men, as&nbsp;curious to&nbsp;me&nbsp;as&nbsp;if&nbsp;they had been prairie-dogs, each sitting at&nbsp;the mouth of&nbsp;its burrow, or&nbsp;running over to&nbsp;a&nbsp;neighbor’s to&nbsp;gossip.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="6" id="idea6" data-nb-words="8" data-nb-chars="48">I&nbsp;went there frequently to&nbsp;observe their habits.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="7" id="idea7" data-nb-words="37" data-nb-chars="191">The village appeared to&nbsp;me&nbsp;a&nbsp;great news room; and on&nbsp;one side, to&nbsp;support it, as&nbsp;once at&nbsp;Redding&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Company’s on&nbsp;State Street, they kept nuts and raisins, or&nbsp;salt and meal and other groceries.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="8" id="idea8" data-nb-words="64" data-nb-chars="396">Some have such a&nbsp;vast appetite for the former commodity, that is, the news, and such sound digestive organs, that they can sit forever in&nbsp;public avenues without stirring, and let it&nbsp;simmer and whisper through them like the Etesian winds, or&nbsp;as&nbsp;if&nbsp;inhaling ether, it&nbsp;only producing numbness and insensibility to&nbsp;pain—otherwise it&nbsp;would often be&nbsp;painful to&nbsp;bear—without affecting the consciousness.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="9" id="idea9" data-nb-words="68" data-nb-chars="381">I&nbsp;hardly ever failed, when I&nbsp;rambled through the village, to&nbsp;see a&nbsp;row of&nbsp;such worthies, either sitting on&nbsp;a&nbsp;ladder sunning themselves, with their bodies inclined forward and their eyes glancing along the line this way and that, from time to&nbsp;time, with a&nbsp;voluptuous expression, or&nbsp;else leaning against a&nbsp;barn with their hands in&nbsp;their pockets, like caryatides, as&nbsp;if&nbsp;to&nbsp;prop it&nbsp;up.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="10" id="idea10" data-nb-words="12" data-nb-chars="66">They, being commonly out of&nbsp;doors, heard whatever was in&nbsp;the wind.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="11" id="idea11" data-nb-words="28" data-nb-chars="160">These are the coarsest mills, in&nbsp;which all gossip is&nbsp;first rudely digested or&nbsp;cracked up&nbsp;before it&nbsp;is&nbsp;emptied into finer and more delicate hoppers within doors.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="12" id="idea12" data-nb-words="79" data-nb-chars="421">I&nbsp;observed that the vitals of&nbsp;the village were the grocery, the barroom, the post-office, and the bank; and, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;necessary part of&nbsp;the machinery, they kept a&nbsp;bell, a&nbsp;big gun, and a&nbsp;fire-engine, at&nbsp;convenient places; and the houses were so&nbsp;arranged as&nbsp;to&nbsp;make the most of&nbsp;mankind, in&nbsp;lanes and fronting one another, so&nbsp;that every traveller had to&nbsp;run the gauntlet, and every man, woman, and child might get a&nbsp;lick at&nbsp;him.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="13" id="idea13" data-nb-words="75" data-nb-chars="403">Of&nbsp;course, those who were stationed nearest to&nbsp;the head of&nbsp;the line, where they could most see and be&nbsp;seen, and have the first blow at&nbsp;him, paid the highest prices for their places; and the few straggling inhabitants in&nbsp;the outskirts, where long gaps in&nbsp;the line began to&nbsp;occur, and the traveller could get over walls or&nbsp;turn aside into cow-paths, and so&nbsp;escape, paid a&nbsp;very slight ground or&nbsp;window tax.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="14" id="idea14" data-nb-words="54" data-nb-chars="277">Signs were hung out on&nbsp;all sides to&nbsp;allure him; some to&nbsp;catch him by&nbsp;the appetite, as&nbsp;the tavern and victualling cellar; some by&nbsp;the fancy, as&nbsp;the dry goods store and the jeweller’s; and others by&nbsp;the hair or&nbsp;the feet or&nbsp;the skirts, as&nbsp;the barber, the shoemaker, or&nbsp;the tailor.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="15" id="idea15" data-nb-words="23" data-nb-chars="138">Besides, there was a&nbsp;still more terrible standing invitation to&nbsp;call at&nbsp;every one of&nbsp;these houses, and company expected about these times.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="16" id="idea16" data-nb-words="63" data-nb-chars="355">For the most part I&nbsp;escaped wonderfully from these dangers, either by&nbsp;proceeding at&nbsp;once boldly and without deliberation to&nbsp;the goal, as&nbsp;is&nbsp;recommended to&nbsp;those who run the gauntlet, or&nbsp;by&nbsp;keeping my&nbsp;thoughts on&nbsp;high things, like Orpheus, who, “loudly singing the praises of&nbsp;the gods to&nbsp;his lyre, drowned the voices of&nbsp;the Sirens, and kept out of&nbsp;danger.”</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="17" id="idea17" data-nb-words="27" data-nb-chars="152">Sometimes I&nbsp;bolted suddenly, and nobody could tell my&nbsp;whereabouts, for I&nbsp;did not stand much about gracefulness, and never hesitated at&nbsp;a&nbsp;gap in&nbsp;a&nbsp;fence.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="18" id="idea18" data-nb-words="60" data-nb-chars="340">I&nbsp;was even accustomed to&nbsp;make an&nbsp;irruption into some houses, where I&nbsp;was well entertained, and after learning the kernels and very last sieveful of&nbsp;news—what had subsided, the prospects of&nbsp;war and peace, and whether the world was likely to&nbsp;hold together much longer—I was let out through the rear avenues, and so&nbsp;escaped to&nbsp;the woods again.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="3" data-nb-words="746" data-nb-chars="3887"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="19" id="idea19" data-nb-words="86" data-nb-chars="452">It was very pleasant, when I&nbsp;stayed late in&nbsp;town, to&nbsp;launch myself into the night, especially if&nbsp;it&nbsp;was dark and tempestuous, and set sail from some bright village parlor or&nbsp;lecture room, with a&nbsp;bag of&nbsp;rye or&nbsp;Indian meal upon my&nbsp;shoulder, for my&nbsp;snug harbor in&nbsp;the woods, having made all tight without and withdrawn under hatches with a&nbsp;merry crew of&nbsp;thoughts, leaving only my&nbsp;outer man at&nbsp;the helm, or&nbsp;even tying up&nbsp;the helm when it&nbsp;was plain sailing.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="20" id="idea20" data-nb-words="13" data-nb-chars="60">I&nbsp;had many a&nbsp;genial thought by&nbsp;the cabin fire “as I&nbsp;sailed.”</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="21" id="idea21" data-nb-words="16" data-nb-chars="93">I&nbsp;was never cast away nor distressed in&nbsp;any weather, though I&nbsp;encountered some severe storms.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="22" id="idea22" data-nb-words="13" data-nb-chars="68">It&nbsp;is&nbsp;darker in&nbsp;the woods, even in&nbsp;common nights, than most suppose.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="23" id="idea23" data-nb-words="77" data-nb-chars="410">I&nbsp;frequently had to&nbsp;look up&nbsp;at&nbsp;the opening between the trees above the path in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;learn my&nbsp;route, and, where there was no&nbsp;cart-path, to&nbsp;feel with my&nbsp;feet the faint track which I&nbsp;had worn, or&nbsp;steer by&nbsp;the known relation of&nbsp;particular trees which I&nbsp;felt with my&nbsp;hands, passing between two pines for instance, not more than eighteen inches apart, in&nbsp;the midst of&nbsp;the woods, invariably, in&nbsp;the darkest night.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="24" id="idea24" data-nb-words="87" data-nb-chars="439">Sometimes, after coming home thus late in&nbsp;a&nbsp;dark and muggy night, when my&nbsp;feet felt the path which my&nbsp;eyes could not see, dreaming and absentminded all the way, until I&nbsp;was aroused by&nbsp;having to&nbsp;raise my&nbsp;hand to&nbsp;lift the latch, I&nbsp;have not been able to&nbsp;recall a&nbsp;single step of&nbsp;my&nbsp;walk, and I&nbsp;have thought that perhaps my&nbsp;body would find its way home if&nbsp;its master should forsake it, as&nbsp;the hand finds its way to&nbsp;the mouth without assistance.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="25" id="idea25" data-nb-words="59" data-nb-chars="292">Several times, when a&nbsp;visitor chanced to&nbsp;stay into evening, and it&nbsp;proved a&nbsp;dark night, I&nbsp;was obliged to&nbsp;conduct him to&nbsp;the cart-path in&nbsp;the rear of&nbsp;the house, and then point out to&nbsp;him the direction he&nbsp;was to&nbsp;pursue, and in&nbsp;keeping which he&nbsp;was to&nbsp;be&nbsp;guided rather by&nbsp;his feet than his eyes.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="26" id="idea26" data-nb-words="20" data-nb-chars="96">One very dark night I&nbsp;directed thus on&nbsp;their way two young men who had been fishing in&nbsp;the pond.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="27" id="idea27" data-nb-words="16" data-nb-chars="80">They lived about a&nbsp;mile off through the woods, and were quite used to&nbsp;the route.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="28" id="idea28" data-nb-words="58" data-nb-chars="303">A&nbsp;day or&nbsp;two after one of&nbsp;them told me&nbsp;that they wandered about the greater part of&nbsp;the night, close by&nbsp;their own premises, and did not get home till toward morning, by&nbsp;which time, as&nbsp;there had been several heavy showers in&nbsp;the meanwhile, and the leaves were very wet, they were drenched to&nbsp;their skins.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="29" id="idea29" data-nb-words="30" data-nb-chars="147">I&nbsp;have heard of&nbsp;many going astray even in&nbsp;the village streets, when the darkness was so&nbsp;thick that you could cut it&nbsp;with a&nbsp;knife, as&nbsp;the saying is.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="30" id="idea30" data-nb-words="52" data-nb-chars="278">Some who live in&nbsp;the outskirts, having come to&nbsp;town a-shopping in&nbsp;their wagons, have been obliged to&nbsp;put up&nbsp;for the night; and gentlemen and ladies making a&nbsp;call have gone half a&nbsp;mile out of&nbsp;their way, feeling the sidewalk only with their feet, and not knowing when they turned.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="31" id="idea31" data-nb-words="19" data-nb-chars="99">It&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;surprising and memorable, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;valuable experience, to&nbsp;be&nbsp;lost in&nbsp;the woods any time.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="32" id="idea32" data-nb-words="28" data-nb-chars="142">Often in&nbsp;a&nbsp;snowstorm, even by&nbsp;day, one will come out upon a&nbsp;well-known road and yet find it&nbsp;impossible to&nbsp;tell which way leads to&nbsp;the village.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="33" id="idea33" data-nb-words="33" data-nb-chars="156">Though he&nbsp;knows that he&nbsp;has travelled it&nbsp;a&nbsp;thousand times, he&nbsp;cannot recognize a&nbsp;feature in&nbsp;it, but it&nbsp;is&nbsp;as&nbsp;strange to&nbsp;him as&nbsp;if&nbsp;it&nbsp;were a&nbsp;road in&nbsp;Siberia.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="34" id="idea34" data-nb-words="9" data-nb-chars="58">By&nbsp;night, of&nbsp;course, the perplexity is&nbsp;infinitely greater.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="35" id="idea35" data-nb-words="76" data-nb-chars="435">In&nbsp;our most trivial walks, we&nbsp;are constantly, though unconsciously, steering like pilots by&nbsp;certain well-known beacons and headlands, and if&nbsp;we&nbsp;go&nbsp;beyond our usual course we&nbsp;still carry in&nbsp;our minds the bearing of&nbsp;some neighboring cape; and not till we&nbsp;are completely lost, or&nbsp;turned round—for a&nbsp;man needs only to&nbsp;be&nbsp;turned round once with his eyes shut in&nbsp;this world to&nbsp;be&nbsp;lost—do we&nbsp;appreciate the vastness and strangeness of&nbsp;nature.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="36" id="idea36" data-nb-words="21" data-nb-chars="112">Every man has to&nbsp;learn the points of&nbsp;compass again as&nbsp;often as&nbsp;he&nbsp;awakes, whether from sleep or&nbsp;any abstraction.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="37" id="idea37" data-nb-words="33" data-nb-chars="167">Not till we&nbsp;are lost, in&nbsp;other words not till we&nbsp;have lost the world, do&nbsp;we&nbsp;begin to&nbsp;find ourselves, and realize where we&nbsp;are and the infinite extent of&nbsp;our relations.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="4" data-nb-words="399" data-nb-chars="2105"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="38" id="idea38" data-nb-words="65" data-nb-chars="337">One afternoon, near the end of&nbsp;the first summer, when I&nbsp;went to&nbsp;the village to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;shoe from the cobbler’s, I&nbsp;was seized and put into jail, because, as&nbsp;I&nbsp;have elsewhere related, I&nbsp;did not pay a&nbsp;tax to, or&nbsp;recognize the authority of, the State which buys and sells men, women, and children, like cattle, at&nbsp;the door of&nbsp;its senate-house.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="39" id="idea39" data-nb-words="10" data-nb-chars="48">I&nbsp;had gone down to&nbsp;the woods for other purposes.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="40" id="idea40" data-nb-words="28" data-nb-chars="165">But, wherever a&nbsp;man goes, men will pursue and paw him with their dirty institutions, and, if&nbsp;they can, constrain him to&nbsp;belong to&nbsp;their desperate odd-fellow society.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="41" id="idea41" data-nb-words="34" data-nb-chars="196">It&nbsp;is&nbsp;true, I&nbsp;might have resisted forcibly with more or&nbsp;less effect, might have run “amok” against society; but I&nbsp;preferred that society should run “amok” against me, it&nbsp;being the desperate party.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="42" id="idea42" data-nb-words="28" data-nb-chars="152">However, I&nbsp;was released the next day, obtained my&nbsp;mended shoe, and returned to&nbsp;the woods in&nbsp;season to&nbsp;get my&nbsp;dinner of&nbsp;huckleberries on&nbsp;Fair Haven Hill.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="43" id="idea43" data-nb-words="13" data-nb-chars="71">I&nbsp;was never molested by&nbsp;any person but those who represented the State.</span>

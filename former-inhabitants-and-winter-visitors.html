          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" id="idea3" data-nb-words="24" data-nb-chars="111">For many weeks I&nbsp;met no&nbsp;one in&nbsp;my&nbsp;walks but those who came occasionally to&nbsp;cut wood and sled it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the village.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="4" id="idea4" data-nb-words="67" data-nb-chars="330">The elements, however, abetted me&nbsp;in&nbsp;making a&nbsp;path through the deepest snow in&nbsp;the woods, for when I&nbsp;had once gone through the wind blew the oak leaves into my&nbsp;tracks, where they lodged, and by&nbsp;absorbing the rays of&nbsp;the sun melted the snow, and so&nbsp;not only made a&nbsp;my&nbsp;bed for my&nbsp;feet, but in&nbsp;the night their dark line was my&nbsp;guide.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="5" id="idea5" data-nb-words="15" data-nb-chars="82">For human society I&nbsp;was obliged to&nbsp;conjure up&nbsp;the former occupants of&nbsp;these woods.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="6" id="idea6" data-nb-words="55" data-nb-chars="299">Within the memory of&nbsp;many of&nbsp;my&nbsp;townsmen the road near which my&nbsp;house stands resounded with the laugh and gossip of&nbsp;inhabitants, and the woods which border it&nbsp;were notched and dotted here and there with their little gardens and dwellings, though it&nbsp;was then much more shut in&nbsp;by&nbsp;the forest than now.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="7" id="idea7" data-nb-words="48" data-nb-chars="244">In&nbsp;some places, within my&nbsp;own remembrance, the pines would scrape both sides of&nbsp;a&nbsp;chaise at&nbsp;once, and women and children who were compelled to&nbsp;go&nbsp;this way to&nbsp;Lincoln alone and on&nbsp;foot did it&nbsp;with fear, and often ran a&nbsp;good part of&nbsp;the distance.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="8" id="idea8" data-nb-words="31" data-nb-chars="178">Though mainly but a&nbsp;humble route to&nbsp;neighboring villages, or&nbsp;for the woodman’s team, it&nbsp;once amused the traveller more than now by&nbsp;its variety, and lingered longer in&nbsp;his memory.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="9" id="idea9" data-nb-words="45" data-nb-chars="263">Where now firm open fields stretch from the village to&nbsp;the woods, it&nbsp;then ran through a&nbsp;maple swamp on&nbsp;a&nbsp;foundation of&nbsp;logs, the remnants of&nbsp;which, doubtless, still underlie the present dusty highway, from the Stratton, now the Alms-House Farm, to&nbsp;Brister’s Hill.</span>

          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="11" id="idea11" data-nb-words="8" data-nb-chars="36">Some say that he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;Guinea Negro.</span>

          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="17" id="idea17" data-nb-words="35" data-nb-chars="178">At&nbsp;length, in&nbsp;the war of&nbsp;1812, her dwelling was set on&nbsp;fire by&nbsp;English soldiers, prisoners on&nbsp;parole, when she was away, and her cat and dog and hens were all burned up&nbsp;together.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="18" id="idea18" data-nb-words="8" data-nb-chars="43">She led a&nbsp;hard life, and somewhat inhumane.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="19" id="idea19" data-nb-words="29" data-nb-chars="164">One old frequenter of&nbsp;these woods remembers, that as&nbsp;he&nbsp;passed her house one noon he&nbsp;heard her muttering to&nbsp;herself over her gurgling pot—“Ye are all bones, bones!”</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="20" id="idea20" data-nb-words="9" data-nb-chars="44">I&nbsp;have seen bricks amid the oak copse there.</span>

          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="22" id="idea22" data-nb-words="53" data-nb-chars="307">Not long since I&nbsp;read his epitaph in&nbsp;the old Lincoln burying-ground, a&nbsp;little on&nbsp;one side, near the unmarked graves of&nbsp;some British grenadiers who fell in&nbsp;the retreat from Concord—where he&nbsp;is&nbsp;styled “Sippio Brister”—Scipio Africanus he&nbsp;had some title to&nbsp;be&nbsp;called—“a man of&nbsp;color,” as&nbsp;if&nbsp;he&nbsp;were discolored.</span>

          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="24" id="idea24" data-nb-words="35" data-nb-chars="203">With him dwelt Fenda, his hospitable wife, who told fortunes, yet pleasantly—large, round, and black, blacker than any of&nbsp;the children of&nbsp;night, such a&nbsp;dusky orb as&nbsp;never rose on&nbsp;Concord before or&nbsp;since.</span>

          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="27" id="idea27" data-nb-words="25" data-nb-chars="135">But history must not yet tell the tragedies enacted here; let time intervene in&nbsp;some measure to&nbsp;assuage and lend an&nbsp;azure tint to&nbsp;them.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="28" id="idea28" data-nb-words="26" data-nb-chars="161">Here the most indistinct and dubious tradition says that once a&nbsp;tavern stood; the well the same, which tempered the traveller’s beverage and refreshed his steed.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="29" id="idea29" data-nb-words="17" data-nb-chars="90">Here then men saluted one another, and heard and told the news, and went their ways again.</span>

          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="33" id="idea33" data-nb-words="82" data-nb-chars="460">I&nbsp;lived on&nbsp;the edge of&nbsp;the village then, and had just lost myself over Davenant’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Gondibert</i>, that winter that I&nbsp;labored with a&nbsp;lethargy—which, by&nbsp;the way, I&nbsp;never knew whether to&nbsp;regard as&nbsp;a&nbsp;family complaint, having an&nbsp;uncle who goes to&nbsp;sleep shaving himself, and is&nbsp;obliged to&nbsp;sprout potatoes in&nbsp;a&nbsp;cellar Sundays, in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;keep awake and keep the Sabbath, or&nbsp;as&nbsp;the consequence of&nbsp;my&nbsp;attempt to&nbsp;read Chalmers’ collection of&nbsp;English poetry without skipping.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="34" id="idea34" data-nb-words="5" data-nb-chars="29">It&nbsp;fairly overcame my&nbsp;Nervii.</span>

          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="36" id="idea36" data-nb-words="21" data-nb-chars="121">We&nbsp;thought it&nbsp;was far south over the woods—we who had run to&nbsp;fires before—barn, shop, or&nbsp;dwelling-house, or&nbsp;all together.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="37" id="idea37" data-nb-words="5" data-nb-chars="31">“It’s Baker’s barn,” cried one.</span>

          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="40" id="idea40" data-nb-words="59" data-nb-chars="329">Wagons shot past with furious speed and crushing loads, bearing, perchance, among the rest, the agent of&nbsp;the Insurance Company, who was bound to&nbsp;go&nbsp;however far; and ever and anon the engine bell tinkled behind, more slow and sure; and rearmost of&nbsp;all, as&nbsp;it&nbsp;was afterward whispered, came they who set the fire and gave the alarm.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="41" id="idea41" data-nb-words="43" data-nb-chars="224">Thus we&nbsp;kept on&nbsp;like true idealists, rejecting the evidence of&nbsp;our senses, until at&nbsp;a&nbsp;turn in&nbsp;the road we&nbsp;heard the crackling and actually felt the heat of&nbsp;the fire from over the wall, and realized, alas! that we&nbsp;were there.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="42" id="idea42" data-nb-words="10" data-nb-chars="51">The very nearness of&nbsp;the fire but cooled our ardor.</span>

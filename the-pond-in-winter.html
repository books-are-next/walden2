          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="34" id="idea34" data-nb-words="28" data-nb-chars="169">They possess a&nbsp;quite dazzling and transcendent beauty which separates them by&nbsp;a&nbsp;wide interval from the cadaverous cod and haddock whose fame is&nbsp;trumpeted in&nbsp;our streets.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="35" id="idea35" data-nb-words="48" data-nb-chars="258">They are not green like the pines, nor gray like the stones, nor blue like the sky; but they have, to&nbsp;my&nbsp;eyes, if&nbsp;possible, yet rarer colors, like flowers and precious stones, as&nbsp;if&nbsp;they were the pearls, the animalized nuclei or&nbsp;crystals of&nbsp;the Walden water.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="36" id="idea36" data-nb-words="19" data-nb-chars="116">They, of&nbsp;course, are Walden all over and all through; are themselves small Waldens in&nbsp;the animal kingdom, Waldenses.</span>

          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="38" id="idea38" data-nb-words="19" data-nb-chars="90">I&nbsp;never chanced to&nbsp;see its kind in&nbsp;any market; it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;the cynosure of&nbsp;all eyes there.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="39" id="idea39" data-nb-words="25" data-nb-chars="139">Easily, with a&nbsp;few convulsive quirks, they give up&nbsp;their watery ghosts, like a&nbsp;mortal translated before his time to&nbsp;the thin air of&nbsp;heaven.</span>

          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="41" id="idea41" data-nb-words="23" data-nb-chars="136">There have been many stories told about the bottom, or&nbsp;rather no&nbsp;bottom, of&nbsp;this pond, which certainly had no&nbsp;foundation for themselves.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="42" id="idea42" data-nb-words="21" data-nb-chars="114">It&nbsp;is&nbsp;remarkable how long men will believe in&nbsp;the bottomlessness of&nbsp;a&nbsp;pond without taking the trouble to&nbsp;sound it.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="43" id="idea43" data-nb-words="13" data-nb-chars="74">I&nbsp;have visited two such Bottomless Ponds in&nbsp;one walk in&nbsp;this neighborhood.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="44" id="idea44" data-nb-words="15" data-nb-chars="84">Many have believed that Walden reached quite through to&nbsp;the other side of&nbsp;the globe.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="45" id="idea45" data-nb-words="74" data-nb-chars="405">Some who have lain flat on&nbsp;the ice for a&nbsp;long time, looking down through the illusive medium, perchance with watery eyes into the bargain, and driven to&nbsp;hasty conclusions by&nbsp;the fear of&nbsp;catching cold in&nbsp;their breasts, have seen vast holes “into which a&nbsp;load of&nbsp;hay might be&nbsp;driven,” if&nbsp;there were anybody to&nbsp;drive it, the undoubted source of&nbsp;the Styx and entrance to&nbsp;the Infernal Regions from these parts.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="46" id="idea46" data-nb-words="52" data-nb-chars="292">Others have gone down from the village with a&nbsp;“fifty-six” and a&nbsp;wagon load of&nbsp;inch rope, but yet have failed to&nbsp;find any bottom; for while the “fifty-six” was resting by&nbsp;the way, they were paying out the rope in&nbsp;the vain attempt to&nbsp;fathom their truly immeasurable capacity for marvellousness.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="47" id="idea47" data-nb-words="22" data-nb-chars="121">But I&nbsp;can assure my&nbsp;readers that Walden has a&nbsp;reasonably tight bottom at&nbsp;a&nbsp;not unreasonable, though at&nbsp;an&nbsp;unusual, depth.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="48" id="idea48" data-nb-words="42" data-nb-chars="218">I&nbsp;fathomed it&nbsp;easily with a&nbsp;cod-line and a&nbsp;stone weighing about a&nbsp;pound and a&nbsp;half, and could tell accurately when the stone left the bottom, by&nbsp;having to&nbsp;pull so&nbsp;much harder before the water got underneath to&nbsp;help me.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="49" id="idea49" data-nb-words="28" data-nb-chars="148">The greatest depth was exactly one hundred and two feet; to&nbsp;which may be&nbsp;added the five feet which it&nbsp;has risen since, making one hundred and seven.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="50" id="idea50" data-nb-words="22" data-nb-chars="104">This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;remarkable depth for so&nbsp;small an&nbsp;area; yet not an&nbsp;inch of&nbsp;it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;spared by&nbsp;the imagination.</span>

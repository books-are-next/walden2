          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" id="idea3" data-nb-words="38" data-nb-chars="204">When I&nbsp;crossed Flint’s Pond, after it&nbsp;was covered with snow, though I&nbsp;had often paddled about and skated over it, it&nbsp;was so&nbsp;unexpectedly wide and so&nbsp;strange that I&nbsp;could think of&nbsp;nothing but Baffin’s Bay.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="4" id="idea4" data-nb-words="65" data-nb-chars="370">The Lincoln hills rose up&nbsp;around me&nbsp;at&nbsp;the extremity of&nbsp;a&nbsp;snowy plain, in&nbsp;which I&nbsp;did not remember to&nbsp;have stood before; and the fishermen, at&nbsp;an&nbsp;indeterminable distance over the ice, moving slowly about with their wolfish dogs, passed for sealers, or&nbsp;Esquimaux, or&nbsp;in&nbsp;misty weather loomed like fabulous creatures, and I&nbsp;did not know whether they were giants or&nbsp;pygmies.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="5" id="idea5" data-nb-words="30" data-nb-chars="152">I&nbsp;took this course when I&nbsp;went to&nbsp;lecture in&nbsp;Lincoln in&nbsp;the evening, travelling in&nbsp;no&nbsp;road and passing no&nbsp;house between my&nbsp;own hut and the lecture room.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="6" id="idea6" data-nb-words="31" data-nb-chars="159">In&nbsp;Goose Pond, which lay in&nbsp;my&nbsp;way, a&nbsp;colony of&nbsp;muskrats dwelt, and raised their cabins high above the ice, though none could be&nbsp;seen abroad when I&nbsp;crossed it.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="7" id="idea7" data-nb-words="46" data-nb-chars="248">Walden, being like the rest usually bare of&nbsp;snow, or&nbsp;with only shallow and interrupted drifts on&nbsp;it, was my&nbsp;yard where I&nbsp;could walk freely when the snow was nearly two feet deep on&nbsp;a&nbsp;level elsewhere and the villagers were confined to&nbsp;their streets.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="8" id="idea8" data-nb-words="43" data-nb-chars="246">There, far from the village street, and except at&nbsp;very long intervals, from the jingle of&nbsp;sleigh-bells, I&nbsp;slid and skated, as&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;vast moose-yard well trodden, overhung by&nbsp;oak woods and solemn pines bent down with snow or&nbsp;bristling with icicles.</span>
        </p>

          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="10" id="idea10" data-nb-words="35" data-nb-chars="202">I&nbsp;seldom opened my&nbsp;door in&nbsp;a&nbsp;winter evening without hearing it; <i>Hoo hoo hoo, hoorer, hoo,</i> sounded sonorously, and the first three syllables accented somewhat like <i>how der do</i>; or&nbsp;sometimes <i>hoo, hoo</i> only.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="11" id="idea11" data-nb-words="49" data-nb-chars="250">One night in&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;winter, before the pond froze over, about nine o’clock, I&nbsp;was startled by&nbsp;the loud honking of&nbsp;a&nbsp;goose, and, stepping to&nbsp;the door, heard the sound of&nbsp;their wings like a&nbsp;tempest in&nbsp;the woods as&nbsp;they flew low over my&nbsp;house.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="12" id="idea12" data-nb-words="25" data-nb-chars="149">They passed over the pond toward Fair Haven, seemingly deterred from settling by&nbsp;my&nbsp;light, their commodore honking all the while with a&nbsp;regular beat.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="13" id="idea13" data-nb-words="62" data-nb-chars="361">Suddenly an&nbsp;unmistakable cat-owl from very near me, with the most harsh and tremendous voice I&nbsp;ever heard from any inhabitant of&nbsp;the woods, responded at&nbsp;regular intervals to&nbsp;the goose, as&nbsp;if&nbsp;determined to&nbsp;expose and disgrace this intruder from Hudson’s Bay by&nbsp;exhibiting a&nbsp;greater compass and volume of&nbsp;voice in&nbsp;a&nbsp;native, and <i>boo-hoo</i> him out of&nbsp;Concord horizon.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="14" id="idea14" data-nb-words="16" data-nb-chars="81">What do&nbsp;you mean by&nbsp;alarming the citadel at&nbsp;this time of&nbsp;night consecrated to&nbsp;me?</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="15" id="idea15" data-nb-words="40" data-nb-chars="201">Do&nbsp;you think I&nbsp;am&nbsp;ever caught napping at&nbsp;such an&nbsp;hour, and that I&nbsp;have not got lungs and a&nbsp;larynx as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;yourself? <i>Boo-hoo, boo-hoo, boo-hoo!</i> It&nbsp;was one of&nbsp;the most thrilling discords I&nbsp;ever heard.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="16" id="idea16" data-nb-words="25" data-nb-chars="126">And yet, if&nbsp;you had a&nbsp;discriminating ear, there were in&nbsp;it&nbsp;the elements of&nbsp;a&nbsp;concord such as&nbsp;these plains never saw nor heard.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="4" data-nb-words="86" data-nb-chars="412"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="17" id="idea17" data-nb-words="86" data-nb-chars="412">I also heard the whooping of&nbsp;the ice in&nbsp;the pond, my&nbsp;great bedfellow in&nbsp;that part of&nbsp;Concord, as&nbsp;if&nbsp;it&nbsp;were restless in&nbsp;its bed and would fain turn over, were troubled with flatulency and had dreams; or&nbsp;I&nbsp;was waked by&nbsp;the cracking of&nbsp;the ground by&nbsp;the frost, as&nbsp;if&nbsp;someone had driven a&nbsp;team against my&nbsp;door, and in&nbsp;the morning would find a&nbsp;crack in&nbsp;the earth a&nbsp;quarter of&nbsp;a&nbsp;mile long and a&nbsp;third of&nbsp;an&nbsp;inch wide.</span></p>

          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="19" id="idea19" data-nb-words="17" data-nb-chars="114">They seemed to&nbsp;me&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;rudimental, burrowing men, still standing on&nbsp;their defence, awaiting their transformation.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="20" id="idea20" data-nb-words="20" data-nb-chars="110">Sometimes one came near to&nbsp;my&nbsp;window, attracted by&nbsp;my&nbsp;light, barked a&nbsp;vulpine curse at&nbsp;me, and then retreated.</span>
        </p>

          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="22" id="idea22" data-nb-words="45" data-nb-chars="220">In&nbsp;the course of&nbsp;the winter I&nbsp;threw out half a&nbsp;bushel of&nbsp;ears of&nbsp;sweet corn, which had not got ripe, on&nbsp;to&nbsp;the snow-crust by&nbsp;my&nbsp;door, and was amused by&nbsp;watching the motions of&nbsp;the various animals which were baited by&nbsp;it.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="23" id="idea23" data-nb-words="15" data-nb-chars="80">In&nbsp;the twilight and the night the rabbits came regularly and made a&nbsp;hearty meal.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="24" id="idea24" data-nb-words="17" data-nb-chars="101">All day long the red squirrels came and went, and afforded me&nbsp;much entertainment by&nbsp;their manoeuvres.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="25" id="idea25" data-nb-words="192" data-nb-chars="1055">One would approach at&nbsp;first warily through the shrub oaks, running over the snow-crust by&nbsp;fits and starts like a&nbsp;leaf blown by&nbsp;the wind, now a&nbsp;few paces this way, with wonderful speed and waste of&nbsp;energy, making inconceivable haste with his “trotters,” as&nbsp;if&nbsp;it&nbsp;were for a&nbsp;wager, and now as&nbsp;many paces that way, but never getting on&nbsp;more than half a&nbsp;rod at&nbsp;a&nbsp;time; and then suddenly pausing with a&nbsp;ludicrous expression and a&nbsp;gratuitous somerset, as&nbsp;if&nbsp;all the eyes in&nbsp;the universe were eyed on&nbsp;him—for all the motions of&nbsp;a&nbsp;squirrel, even in&nbsp;the most solitary recesses of&nbsp;the forest, imply spectators as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;those of&nbsp;a&nbsp;dancing girl—wasting more time in&nbsp;delay and circumspection than would have sufficed to&nbsp;walk the whole distance—I never saw one walk—and then suddenly, before you could say Jack Robinson, he&nbsp;would be&nbsp;in&nbsp;the top of&nbsp;a&nbsp;young pitch pine, winding up&nbsp;his clock and chiding all imaginary spectators, soliloquizing and talking to&nbsp;all the universe at&nbsp;the same time—for no&nbsp;reason that I&nbsp;could ever detect, or&nbsp;he&nbsp;himself was aware of, I&nbsp;suspect.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="26" id="idea26" data-nb-words="156" data-nb-chars="828">At&nbsp;length he&nbsp;would reach the corn, and selecting a&nbsp;suitable ear, frisk about in&nbsp;the same uncertain trigonometrical way to&nbsp;the topmost stick of&nbsp;my&nbsp;woodpile, before my&nbsp;window, where he&nbsp;looked me&nbsp;in&nbsp;the face, and there sit for hours, supplying himself with a&nbsp;new ear from time to&nbsp;time, nibbling at&nbsp;first voraciously and throwing the half-naked cobs about; till at&nbsp;length he&nbsp;grew more dainty still and played with his food, tasting only the inside of&nbsp;the kernel, and the ear, which was held balanced over the stick by&nbsp;one paw, slipped from his careless grasp and fell to&nbsp;the ground, when he&nbsp;would look over at&nbsp;it&nbsp;with a&nbsp;ludicrous expression of&nbsp;uncertainty, as&nbsp;if&nbsp;suspecting that it&nbsp;had life, with a&nbsp;mind not made up&nbsp;whether to&nbsp;get it&nbsp;again, or&nbsp;a&nbsp;new one, or&nbsp;be&nbsp;off; now thinking of&nbsp;corn, then listening to&nbsp;hear what was in&nbsp;the wind.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="27" id="idea27" data-nb-words="134" data-nb-chars="746">So&nbsp;the little impudent fellow would waste many an&nbsp;ear in&nbsp;a&nbsp;forenoon; till at&nbsp;last, seizing some longer and plumper one, considerably bigger than himself, and skilfully balancing it, he&nbsp;would set out with it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the woods, like a&nbsp;tiger with a&nbsp;buffalo, by&nbsp;the same zigzag course and frequent pauses, scratching along with it&nbsp;as&nbsp;if&nbsp;it&nbsp;were too heavy for him and falling all the while, making its fall a&nbsp;diagonal between a&nbsp;perpendicular and horizontal, being determined to&nbsp;put it&nbsp;through at&nbsp;any rate;—a singularly frivolous and whimsical fellow;—and so&nbsp;he&nbsp;would get off with it&nbsp;to&nbsp;where he&nbsp;lived, perhaps carry it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the top of&nbsp;a&nbsp;pine tree forty or&nbsp;fifty rods distant, and I&nbsp;would afterwards find the cobs strewn about the woods in&nbsp;various directions.</span>

          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="29" id="idea29" data-nb-words="49" data-nb-chars="258">Then, sitting on&nbsp;a&nbsp;pitch pine bough, they attempt to&nbsp;swallow in&nbsp;their haste a&nbsp;kernel which is&nbsp;too big for their throats and chokes them; and after great labor they disgorge it, and spend an&nbsp;hour in&nbsp;the endeavor to&nbsp;crack it&nbsp;by&nbsp;repeated blows with their bills.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="30" id="idea30" data-nb-words="31" data-nb-chars="162">They were manifestly thieves, and I&nbsp;had not much respect for them; but the squirrels, though at&nbsp;first shy, went to&nbsp;work as&nbsp;if&nbsp;they were taking what was their own.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="8" data-nb-words="199" data-nb-chars="1080"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="31" id="idea31" data-nb-words="53" data-nb-chars="310">Meanwhile also came the chickadees in&nbsp;flocks, which, picking up&nbsp;the crumbs the squirrels had dropped, flew to&nbsp;the nearest twig and, placing them under their claws, hammered away at&nbsp;them with their little bills, as&nbsp;if&nbsp;it&nbsp;were an&nbsp;insect in&nbsp;the bark, till they were sufficiently reduced for their slender throats.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="32" id="idea32" data-nb-words="55" data-nb-chars="296">A&nbsp;little flock of&nbsp;these titmice came daily to&nbsp;pick a&nbsp;dinner out of&nbsp;my&nbsp;woodpile, or&nbsp;the crumbs at&nbsp;my&nbsp;door, with faint flitting lisping notes, like the tinkling of&nbsp;icicles in&nbsp;the grass, or&nbsp;else with sprightly <i>day day day</i>, or&nbsp;more rarely, in&nbsp;springlike days, a&nbsp;wiry summery <i>phe-be</i> from the woodside.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="33" id="idea33" data-nb-words="26" data-nb-chars="134">They were so&nbsp;familiar that at&nbsp;length one alighted on&nbsp;an&nbsp;armful of&nbsp;wood which I&nbsp;was carrying in, and pecked at&nbsp;the sticks without fear.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="34" id="idea34" data-nb-words="43" data-nb-chars="217">I&nbsp;once had a&nbsp;sparrow alight upon my&nbsp;shoulder for a&nbsp;moment while I&nbsp;was hoeing in&nbsp;a&nbsp;village garden, and I&nbsp;felt that I&nbsp;was more distinguished by&nbsp;that circumstance than I&nbsp;should have been by&nbsp;any epaulet I&nbsp;could have worn.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="35" id="idea35" data-nb-words="22" data-nb-chars="123">The squirrels also grew at&nbsp;last to&nbsp;be&nbsp;quite familiar, and occasionally stepped upon my&nbsp;shoe, when that was the nearest way.</span>

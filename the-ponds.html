          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="11" id="idea11" data-nb-words="47" data-nb-chars="251">There was one older man, an&nbsp;excellent fisher and skilled in&nbsp;all kinds of&nbsp;woodcraft, who was pleased to&nbsp;look upon my&nbsp;house as&nbsp;a&nbsp;building erected for the convenience of&nbsp;fishermen; and I&nbsp;was equally pleased when he&nbsp;sat in&nbsp;my&nbsp;doorway to&nbsp;arrange his lines.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="12" id="idea12" data-nb-words="51" data-nb-chars="256">Once in&nbsp;a&nbsp;while we&nbsp;sat together on&nbsp;the pond, he&nbsp;at&nbsp;one end of&nbsp;the boat, and I&nbsp;at&nbsp;the other; but not many words passed between us, for he&nbsp;had grown deaf in&nbsp;his later years, but he&nbsp;occasionally hummed a&nbsp;psalm, which harmonized well enough with my&nbsp;philosophy.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="13" id="idea13" data-nb-words="23" data-nb-chars="132">Our intercourse was thus altogether one of&nbsp;unbroken harmony, far more pleasing to&nbsp;remember than if&nbsp;it&nbsp;had been carried on&nbsp;by&nbsp;speech.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="14" id="idea14" data-nb-words="61" data-nb-chars="325">When, as&nbsp;was commonly the case, I&nbsp;had none to&nbsp;commune with, I&nbsp;used to&nbsp;raise the echoes by&nbsp;striking with a&nbsp;paddle on&nbsp;the side of&nbsp;my&nbsp;boat, filling the surrounding woods with circling and dilating sound, stirring them up&nbsp;as&nbsp;the keeper of&nbsp;a&nbsp;menagerie his wild beasts, until I&nbsp;elicited a&nbsp;growl from every wooded vale and hillside.</span>
        </p>

          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="16" id="idea16" data-nb-words="85" data-nb-chars="467">Formerly I&nbsp;had come to&nbsp;this pond adventurously, from time to&nbsp;time, in&nbsp;dark summer nights, with a&nbsp;companion, and, making a&nbsp;fire close to&nbsp;the water’s edge, which we&nbsp;thought attracted the fishes, we&nbsp;caught pouts with a&nbsp;bunch of&nbsp;worms strung on&nbsp;a&nbsp;thread, and when we&nbsp;had done, far in&nbsp;the night, threw the burning brands high into the air like skyrockets, which, coming down into the pond, were quenched with a&nbsp;loud hissing, and we&nbsp;were suddenly groping in&nbsp;total darkness.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="17" id="idea17" data-nb-words="15" data-nb-chars="75">Through this, whistling a&nbsp;tune, we&nbsp;took our way to&nbsp;the haunts of&nbsp;men again.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="18" id="idea18" data-nb-words="10" data-nb-chars="40">But now I&nbsp;had made my&nbsp;home by&nbsp;the shore.</span>

          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="20" id="idea20" data-nb-words="106" data-nb-chars="640">These experiences were very memorable and valuable to&nbsp;me—anchored in&nbsp;forty feet of&nbsp;water, and twenty or&nbsp;thirty rods from the shore, surrounded sometimes by&nbsp;thousands of&nbsp;small perch and shiners, dimpling the surface with their tails in&nbsp;the moonlight, and communicating by&nbsp;a&nbsp;long flaxen line with mysterious nocturnal fishes which had their dwelling forty feet below, or&nbsp;sometimes dragging sixty feet of&nbsp;line about the pond as&nbsp;I&nbsp;drifted in&nbsp;the gentle night breeze, now and then feeling a&nbsp;slight vibration along it, indicative of&nbsp;some life prowling about its extremity, of&nbsp;dull uncertain blundering purpose there, and slow to&nbsp;make up&nbsp;its mind.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="21" id="idea21" data-nb-words="19" data-nb-chars="110">At&nbsp;length you slowly raise, pulling hand over hand, some horned pout squeaking and squirming to&nbsp;the upper air.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="22" id="idea22" data-nb-words="38" data-nb-chars="216">It&nbsp;was very queer, especially in&nbsp;dark nights, when your thoughts had wandered to&nbsp;vast and cosmogonal themes in&nbsp;other spheres, to&nbsp;feel this faint jerk, which came to&nbsp;interrupt your dreams and link you to&nbsp;Nature again.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="23" id="idea23" data-nb-words="26" data-nb-chars="132">It&nbsp;seemed as&nbsp;if&nbsp;I&nbsp;might next cast my&nbsp;line upward into the air, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;downward into this element, which was scarcely more dense.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="24" id="idea24" data-nb-words="11" data-nb-chars="50">Thus I&nbsp;caught two fishes as&nbsp;it&nbsp;were with one hook.</span>

          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="26" id="idea26" data-nb-words="51" data-nb-chars="275">It&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;clear and deep green well, half a&nbsp;mile long and a&nbsp;mile and three quarters in&nbsp;circumference, and contains about sixty-one and a&nbsp;half acres; a&nbsp;perennial spring in&nbsp;the midst of&nbsp;pine and oak woods, without any visible inlet or&nbsp;outlet except by&nbsp;the clouds and evaporation.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="27" id="idea27" data-nb-words="44" data-nb-chars="240">The surrounding hills rise abruptly from the water to&nbsp;the height of&nbsp;forty to&nbsp;eighty feet, though on&nbsp;the southeast and east they attain to&nbsp;about one hundred and one hundred and fifty feet respectively, within a&nbsp;quarter and a&nbsp;third of&nbsp;a&nbsp;mile.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="28" id="idea28" data-nb-words="4" data-nb-chars="30">They are exclusively woodland.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="29" id="idea29" data-nb-words="22" data-nb-chars="120">All our Concord waters have two colors at&nbsp;least; one when viewed at&nbsp;a&nbsp;distance, and another, more proper, close at&nbsp;hand.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="30" id="idea30" data-nb-words="11" data-nb-chars="57">The first depends more on&nbsp;the light, and follows the sky.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="31" id="idea31" data-nb-words="23" data-nb-chars="133">In&nbsp;clear weather, in&nbsp;summer, they appear blue at&nbsp;a&nbsp;little distance, especially if&nbsp;agitated, and at&nbsp;a&nbsp;great distance all appear alike.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="32" id="idea32" data-nb-words="10" data-nb-chars="59">In&nbsp;stormy weather they are sometimes of&nbsp;a&nbsp;dark slate-color.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="33" id="idea33" data-nb-words="20" data-nb-chars="112">The sea, however, is&nbsp;said to&nbsp;be&nbsp;blue one day and green another without any perceptible change in&nbsp;the atmosphere.</span>

          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="35" id="idea35" data-nb-words="14" data-nb-chars="76">Some consider blue “to be&nbsp;the color of&nbsp;pure water, whether liquid or&nbsp;solid.”</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="36" id="idea36" data-nb-words="19" data-nb-chars="101">But, looking directly down into our waters from a&nbsp;boat, they are seen to&nbsp;be&nbsp;of&nbsp;very different colors.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="37" id="idea37" data-nb-words="17" data-nb-chars="82">Walden is&nbsp;blue at&nbsp;one time and green at&nbsp;another, even from the same point of&nbsp;view.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="38" id="idea38" data-nb-words="14" data-nb-chars="74">Lying between the earth and the heavens, it&nbsp;partakes of&nbsp;the color of&nbsp;both.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="39" id="idea39" data-nb-words="48" data-nb-chars="234">Viewed from a&nbsp;hilltop it&nbsp;reflects the color of&nbsp;the sky; but near at&nbsp;hand it&nbsp;is&nbsp;of&nbsp;a&nbsp;yellowish tint next the shore where you can see the sand, then a&nbsp;light green, which gradually deepens to&nbsp;a&nbsp;uniform dark green in&nbsp;the body of&nbsp;the pond.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="40" id="idea40" data-nb-words="17" data-nb-chars="82">In&nbsp;some lights, viewed even from a&nbsp;hilltop, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;of&nbsp;a&nbsp;vivid green next the shore.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="41" id="idea41" data-nb-words="47" data-nb-chars="259">Some have referred this to&nbsp;the reflection of&nbsp;the verdure; but it&nbsp;is&nbsp;equally green there against the railroad sandbank, and in&nbsp;the spring, before the leaves are expanded, and it&nbsp;may be&nbsp;simply the result of&nbsp;the prevailing blue mixed with the yellow of&nbsp;the sand.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="42" id="idea42" data-nb-words="7" data-nb-chars="30">Such is&nbsp;the color of&nbsp;its iris.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="43" id="idea43" data-nb-words="41" data-nb-chars="227">This is&nbsp;that portion, also, where in&nbsp;the spring, the ice being warmed by&nbsp;the heat of&nbsp;the sun reflected from the bottom, and also transmitted through the earth, melts first and forms a&nbsp;narrow canal about the still frozen middle.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="44" id="idea44" data-nb-words="115" data-nb-chars="637">Like the rest of&nbsp;our waters, when much agitated, in&nbsp;clear weather, so&nbsp;that the surface of&nbsp;the waves may reflect the sky at&nbsp;the right angle, or&nbsp;because there is&nbsp;more light mixed with it, it&nbsp;appears at&nbsp;a&nbsp;little distance of&nbsp;a&nbsp;darker blue than the sky itself; and at&nbsp;such a&nbsp;time, being on&nbsp;its surface, and looking with divided vision, so&nbsp;as&nbsp;to&nbsp;see the reflection, I&nbsp;have discerned a&nbsp;matchless and indescribable light blue, such as&nbsp;watered or&nbsp;changeable silks and sword blades suggest, more cerulean than the sky itself, alternating with the original dark green on&nbsp;the opposite sides of&nbsp;the waves, which last appeared but muddy in&nbsp;comparison.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="45" id="idea45" data-nb-words="26" data-nb-chars="140">It&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;vitreous greenish blue, as&nbsp;I&nbsp;remember it, like those patches of&nbsp;the winter sky seen through cloud vistas in&nbsp;the west before sundown.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="46" id="idea46" data-nb-words="21" data-nb-chars="97">Yet a&nbsp;single glass of&nbsp;its water held up&nbsp;to&nbsp;the light is&nbsp;as&nbsp;colorless as&nbsp;an&nbsp;equal quantity of&nbsp;air.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="47" id="idea47" data-nb-words="33" data-nb-chars="158">It&nbsp;is&nbsp;well known that a&nbsp;large plate of&nbsp;glass will have a&nbsp;green tint, owing, as&nbsp;the makers say, to&nbsp;its “body,” but a&nbsp;small piece of&nbsp;the same will be&nbsp;colorless.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="48" id="idea48" data-nb-words="19" data-nb-chars="95">How large a&nbsp;body of&nbsp;Walden water would be&nbsp;required to&nbsp;reflect a&nbsp;green tint I&nbsp;have never proved.</span>

          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="24" id="idea24" data-nb-words="28" data-nb-chars="152">Early in&nbsp;the morning I&nbsp;worked barefooted, dabbling like a&nbsp;plastic artist in&nbsp;the dewy and crumbling sand, but later in&nbsp;the day the sun blistered my&nbsp;feet.</span>

          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="27" id="idea27" data-nb-words="33" data-nb-chars="176">As&nbsp;I&nbsp;had little aid from horses or&nbsp;cattle, or&nbsp;hired men or&nbsp;boys, or&nbsp;improved implements of&nbsp;husbandry, I&nbsp;was much slower, and became much more intimate with my&nbsp;beans than usual.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="28" id="idea28" data-nb-words="21" data-nb-chars="112">But labor of&nbsp;the hands, even when pursued to&nbsp;the verge of&nbsp;drudgery, is&nbsp;perhaps never the worst form of&nbsp;idleness.</span>

          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="36" id="idea36" data-nb-words="34" data-nb-chars="169">But here were two acres and a&nbsp;half of&nbsp;furrows, and only a&nbsp;hoe for cart and two hands to&nbsp;draw it—there being an&nbsp;aversion to&nbsp;other carts and horses—and chip dirt far away.</span>

          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="6" id="idea6" data-nb-words="12" data-nb-chars="60">When chestnuts were ripe I&nbsp;laid up&nbsp;half a&nbsp;bushel for winter.</span>

          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="8" id="idea8" data-nb-words="7" data-nb-chars="43">Occasionally I&nbsp;climbed and shook the trees.</span>

          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="10" id="idea10" data-nb-words="13" data-nb-chars="66">These nuts, as&nbsp;far as&nbsp;they went, were a&nbsp;good substitute for bread.</span>

          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="13" id="idea13" data-nb-words="24" data-nb-chars="129">I&nbsp;had often since seen its crumpled red velvety blossom supported by&nbsp;the stems of&nbsp;other plants without knowing it&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the same.</span>

          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="16" id="idea16" data-nb-words="23" data-nb-chars="122">This tuber seemed like a&nbsp;faint promise of&nbsp;Nature to&nbsp;rear her own children and feed them simply here at&nbsp;some future period.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="17" id="idea17" data-nb-words="124" data-nb-chars="698">In&nbsp;these days of&nbsp;fatted cattle and waving grainfields this humble root, which was once the totem of&nbsp;an&nbsp;Indian tribe, is&nbsp;quite forgotten, or&nbsp;known only by&nbsp;its flowering vine; but let wild Nature reign here once more, and the tender and luxurious English grains will probably disappear before a&nbsp;myriad of&nbsp;foes, and without the care of&nbsp;man the crow may carry back even the last seed of&nbsp;corn to&nbsp;the great cornfield of&nbsp;the Indian’s God in&nbsp;the southwest, whence he&nbsp;is&nbsp;said to&nbsp;have brought it; but the now almost exterminated groundnut will perhaps revive and flourish in&nbsp;spite of&nbsp;frosts and wildness, prove itself indigenous, and resume its ancient importance and dignity as&nbsp;the diet of&nbsp;the hunter tribe.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="18" id="idea18" data-nb-words="36" data-nb-chars="191">Some Indian Ceres or&nbsp;Minerva must have been the inventor and bestower of&nbsp;it; and when the reign of&nbsp;poetry commences here, its leaves and string of&nbsp;nuts may be&nbsp;represented on&nbsp;our works of&nbsp;art.</span>

          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="24" id="idea24" data-nb-words="39" data-nb-chars="203">Each morning, when they were numbed with cold, I&nbsp;swept some of&nbsp;them out, but I&nbsp;did not trouble myself much to&nbsp;get rid of&nbsp;them; I&nbsp;even felt complimented by&nbsp;their regarding my&nbsp;house as&nbsp;a&nbsp;desirable shelter.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="25" id="idea25" data-nb-words="26" data-nb-chars="165">They never molested me&nbsp;seriously, though they bedded with me; and they gradually disappeared, into what crevices I&nbsp;do&nbsp;not know, avoiding winter and unspeakable cold.</span>

          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="27" id="idea27" data-nb-words="18" data-nb-chars="100">I&nbsp;thus warmed myself by&nbsp;the still glowing embers which the summer, like a&nbsp;departed hunter, had left.</span>

          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="31" id="idea31" data-nb-words="27" data-nb-chars="145">Such sayings themselves grow harder and adhere more firmly with age, and it&nbsp;would take many blows with a&nbsp;trowel to&nbsp;clean an&nbsp;old wiseacre of&nbsp;them.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="32" id="idea32" data-nb-words="33" data-nb-chars="185">Many of&nbsp;the villages of&nbsp;Mesopotamia are built of&nbsp;secondhand bricks of&nbsp;a&nbsp;very good quality, obtained from the ruins of&nbsp;Babylon, and the cement on&nbsp;them is&nbsp;older and probably harder still.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="33" id="idea33" data-nb-words="24" data-nb-chars="129">However that may be, I&nbsp;was struck by&nbsp;the peculiar toughness of&nbsp;the steel which bore so&nbsp;many violent blows without being worn out.</span>
